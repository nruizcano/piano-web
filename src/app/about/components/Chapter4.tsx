      <h2>Reigniting My Passion for Piano</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        A couple of years later, in 2023, that spark started to flicker again. I
        found myself reminiscing about the times I spent playing piano — all the
        songs I had wanted to learn but never did, the sense of accomplishment,
        and the feeling of belonging to a world where I felt welcomed. That led
        me to buy a Korg B2 keyboard and start playing once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being away from piano for so long, I was worried that I might have
        to start completely from scratch. Fortunately, that wasn’t the case. The
        first piece I tackled was <i>Bloody Tears</i> from Castlevania and
        muscle memory kicked in incredibly quickly: my fingers remembered the
        movements, even if not the exact keys. With the sheet music in hand, I
        relearned the entire piece in a single evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        I resumed learning songs I enjoyed, but at first it didn’t feel as
        fulfilling as before. I questioned whether returning to piano was the
        right choice. I was a completely different person now, and the hobby
        felt incomplete without purpose. The breakthrough came when I realized
        the issue wasn’t piano itself — it was my approach to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I would learn a song, move on, and never revisit it. That
        made the effort feel wasted when I eventually forgot it. To give my
        practice meaning, I started recording my performances. Each new song was
        learned with the intention of creating a recording — a tangible,
        revisitable representation of my effort and personal interpretation.
        Much like a sportsperson earns medals or trophies to commemorate
        achievements, my recordings became my trophies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shift in mindset transformed the way I practice piano and how I
        feel about every step of the way. I still enjoy improving my skills and
        tackling pieces I couldn’t before, but now I have an added reward — a
        lasting record of my progress and journey.

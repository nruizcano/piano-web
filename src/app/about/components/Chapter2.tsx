      <h2>Discovering the Piano</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        My first real contact with the piano came thanks to my best friend at
        the time, who had just started learning. It immediately caught my
        attention, and the idea of sharing that hobby with her sounded fun. Not
        everyone was supportive — some people even said it would be too
        difficult for me — but my parents believed in me and gifted me a small
        54-key Casio keyboard.

      <p>
        From the very beginning I fell in love wiht it. I started teaching
        myself simple pieces, like the famous <i>Für Elise</i>. After a few
        months, I upgraded to another Casio keyboard, this time with 61 keys and
        a sustain pedal, and signed up for group piano lessons at my school with
        my friend and another classmate.

        Those lessons were all about playing together as a trio. We even
        performed in a small school concert, where we played <i>Get Lucky</i> by
        Daft Punk and <i>Mamma Mia</i> by ABBA. Not long after, I received the
        biggest surprise of my life: my parents gifted me a full-sized digital
        piano — my beloved Kawai CN24 ✨ That was the turning point when things
        started to get more serious.

        I soon began private piano lessons with the wonderful Ana and her Kawai
        grand piano. She was demanding yet kind, and she knew exactly how to
        help me grow. With her I explored the world of classical music — Chopin,
        Mozart, Czerny, Bach — as well as modern repertoire for duets, where I
        played piano while my classmate sang. Those lessons were incredibly
        enriching, and I’m very grateful for that experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I paused formal lessons, mainly because of school-related
        time constraints. Still, I kept learning on my own, mostly by playing
        piano covers of modern songs. That carried me forward until I reached a
        new stopping point...

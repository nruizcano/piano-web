      <h2>When I Let Go of Piano</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        School began to take a heavy toll on me â€” not just in terms of time, but
        also my energy, confidence, and overall well-being. On top of that,
        things in my personal life werenâ€™t going so well either, which affected
        my mental health significantly. Eventually, I reached a point where I
        had lost the desire to play altogether. My piano sat in the corner of my
        room, gathering dust.

        Life moved on, and as a full-time student in need of money, I faced a
        tough choice. I ultimately decided to sell my piano. It was one of the
        hardest decisions Iâ€™ve ever made, because deep down I still held on to
        the hope that one day Iâ€™d return to playing when circumstances improved.
        Letting it go felt like abandoning a part of myself that had brought me
        so much joy even in the darkest of times ðŸ’”

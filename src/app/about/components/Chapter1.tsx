        I was born in Málaga, Spain, in 2002, and I’ve lived here my whole life
        — though I’ve always dreamed of moving abroad, currently with Germany in
        mind.

        Even though neither of my parents pursued music professionally, I grew
        up surrounded by it. My dad plays the guitar, and our home was always
        filled with music. Oasis was on repeat and eventually became my all-time
        favorite band, but I also grew up listening to Green Day, The Beatles,
        Queen, and The Rolling Stones. On the Spanish music scene, I was heavily
        influenced by Pereza, Love of Lesbian, Miss Caffeina, and Iván Ferreiro.
        I feel very lucky to have developed such a diverse and rich taste in
        music.

        Despite being constantly exposed to music, I didn’t start playing an
        instrument until I was 11 years old.

      <h2>Sharing My Passion</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        At the beginning of 2024, I started recording myself and shyly sharing
        videos on my <SocialLink social={Socials.INSTAGRAM} /> account, the
        first being <i>Donâ€™t Look Back In Anger</i> by Oasis. Even though I
        didnâ€™t have many followers and my profile was private at the time, I
        still felt a bit insecure. Yet, I wanted people to see what I was doing,
        to showcase something I truly loved and felt proud of. My posting pace
        was slow at first, but it gradually improved in 2025 when a big change
        happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m not trying to suggest that &ldquo;the instrument makes the
        instrumentalist&rdquo;, because it doesnâ€™t. However, having the right
        instrument can make the experience more enjoyable. Since day one, my
        piano had a technical issue: a noticeable hiss or white noise that grew
        louder over time, sometimes even louder than the keys themselves. This
        only appeared through the headphones, which is why you canâ€™t hear it in
        the recordings. After dealing with this for a while, I decided to
        replace it with the best digital piano Iâ€™ve ever had, the Roland FP-30X.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference was night and day. I could hear every nuance clearly, and
        the feel and responsiveness of the keys gave me so much more room to be
        creative and playful. I feel incredibly fortunate to have such an
        outstanding instrument to play every day, which has motivated me even
        more and accelerated my learning progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until May 31st, 2025, every video I made stayed private on{" "}
        <SocialLink social={Socials.INSTAGRAM} /> and{" "}
        <SocialLink social={Socials.YOUTUBE} />. On that day, out of nowhere, I
        decided to make all my videos public â€” both old and new. It was one of
        the best decisions Iâ€™ve made. Even though I donâ€™t have a huge audience,
        the small, supportive community that has formed is wonderful. Receiving
        comments on almost every video from people who enjoyed my performance is
        incredibly heartwarming ðŸ©µ
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing my piano journey has rekindled my passion and made every
        recording session feel exciting. Time constraints are challenging â€” if I
        could, I would spend the entire day playing and recording â€” but each
        upload has become a special event. I hope to continue sharing this
        passion for a long long time.
